Immediately we are greeted with smiles as the restaurant is already filled with chefs getting to work, and the smell of the delicious Basque Cheesecake fills the room. Tomos slips into the bustle and greets all of his team as old friends and then greets us with a smile. We settle down at one of the tables at the back “this is my favourite table”, pointing up at the inscription above him, “we inherited the wood and all of its character from the Strip Club that was here before” he tells us with a smile. The character and juxtaposition of the old wood, comforting smells of cooking over an open fire with the glitz of a Michelin star are personified by Tomos and his humble nature.

I imagine if I grew up in Central London or something I’d have a different perspective of what it means to cook over a fire.

I just love it, I love the connection, and the flexibility, I love how many senses are engaged when you’re cooking like that. When you’ve got the fire, there’s smoke, you can smell it, you can hear it, you can see it, and you can taste it. I like that dynamic side of cooking over fire.<\/p>",

There are many cities, such as New York, where it is very hard to cook over wood and charcoal in a central location. So actually, there is quite a bit of freedom here which is great. It does come with natural constraints, such as old or listed buildings that you don’t want to burn down. I kind of like having restrictions anyway, because I feel that my creativity is better when I have restrictions to work within. I also really like the idea of bringing some of that rural cooking into central London. You’re committing to something when you visit the restaurant, and you’re escaping the bustling city and busy London life when you come upstairs and see fish cooking over an open fire. There’s something quite nice and quite comforting about that.<\/p>",

We do make all of our own sausages and cures, ferments and so, yeah, we do quite a bit in-house. So my idea would be a collaboration between beautiful artisans, fishermen, and local producers. I just love creating networks around it, so that there is a mini ecosystem behind the restaurant. In one way I like making things, but I also love building those connections. For instance, for the new restaurant, we will be working with a small organic farmer and he will be making us a semi-cured sausage, which I guess you could compare to a Chorizo, and he’s making it just for us and will be sending it over in huge quantities. That idea is we’re working with them, they’re creating their own chillies, we’ve been out there to work with them, and we’re tasting it regularly and essentially we’re making it with them but it’s their project and I love that collaboration idea. And similarly, we’re making our own Vermouth in Sicily as well, we could make that, but I love this idea of working with them to make it.<\/p>",

It’s an industry that uniquely allows a huge amount of freedom, a healthy lifestyle of meeting people, travelling, experiencing new cultures and mixing everything. I think food breaks down a lot of barriers, we’ve got a long way to go with that of course. But for me, the reason I went into cooking is that I love the human feel to it, I like that interaction. We have open kitchens in all of our restaurants for many reasons but the guests love seeing them, and we love seeing the guests and talking to them. I like the synergy, the collaborations with the farmers, and the culture. It’s one thing opening a restaurant and cooking, but I also love being a part of the fabric of the place you’re in. <\/p><p>Every day is different, it comes with its challenges.

You have to already show an established practice and a commitment to the craft and doing it as a career rather than just a hobby. They also like to see evidence that you’re going to innovate your practice and promote the craft sector as a whole across the country. It’s a three month long process, 200 people applied when I applied and only 20 people got it. It’s all quite intense, but you also receive funding to do further training which is amazing, so I’ve got training with three different master trainers. Hopefully I’ll learn some really amazing stuff which will take our practice to a whole different level. It’s a very special thing to be involved with.<\/p>",
